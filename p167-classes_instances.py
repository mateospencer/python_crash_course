#	Section 9-4: Number Served
#	Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an attribute called number_served with
#	a default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of
#	customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again. 
#	Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been
#	served. Call this method with a new number and print the value again. 
#	Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers
#	who've been served. Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many
#	customers were served in, say, a day of business.
