#	Section 6-4: Glossary 2
#	Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3
#	(page 99) by replacing your series of print() calls with a loop that runs through the
#	dictionary's keys and values. When you're sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms 
#	to your glossary. When you run your progam again, these new words and meanings should
#	automatically be included in the output.
