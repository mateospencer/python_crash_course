#	Section 9-6: Ice Cream Stand
#	An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a clas called IceCreamStand that
#	inherits from the Restaurant class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4
#	(page 167). Either version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an 
#	attribute called flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays
#	these flavors. Crate an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.
