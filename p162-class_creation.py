#	Section 9-1: Restaurant
#	Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two
#	attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant()
#	that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints
#	a message indicating that the restaurant is open. 
#	Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and
#	then call both methods.
