This repo collects Python exercises learned via the 2nd Edition of Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course: A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming. The book is available via No Starch Press or Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Project-Based-Introduction/dp/1593276036) and its code is available here (https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/).

Note: 
* Some code in this repo may have purposeful errors where the assignment asked for a value to be changed to demonstrate an error. 
* Some code may be duplicated as data is altered later or reused to teach new concepts. 
* Some code will be inefficient because it follows what has been learned up to that point in the book. 
* Code is excessively commented. This is because this code doubles as notes for me to refer back to or to help me with jumping back and forth between concepts. I will try to stick to PEP-8 conventions as much as possible and will update formatting as I learn it. 
* Any feedback is welcome. I have so much to learn.
