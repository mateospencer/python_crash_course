Notes regarding this repo:
* Repo collects (mostly) python exercises learned via the 2nd Edition of Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course: A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming. 

* The code may have purposeful errors where the assignment asked for a value to be changed to demonstrate an error. 

* Some code may be duplicated as data is altered later. 

* Some code will be inefficient because it follows what has been learned up to that point in the book. 

* In retrospect, it would have made plenty of sense to organize the code by its location in the book in the file names which is why the file naming format changes. I'll use the opportunity to add comments on even simple files in order to make it more useful to others who may be going through the texts themselves and to get into the habit of adding better comments to my code.
